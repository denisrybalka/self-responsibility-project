# Self-responisibility project

**Hi!**
This is my first ever React JS Web App. `"Self-responsibility project"`.

Basically my application is pretty similar to the usual *todo-app*. But I did it more complicated, with more functionality than simple *todo-app* that you can imagine.

**What technologies did I used?**

- **Figma**
- **Adobe Photoshop CS6**
- **Inksape** (for icons)
- **React JS**
- **react-router-dom**
