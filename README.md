# Self-responisibility project

![image](https://i.imgur.com/43e6Smd.png)

## Hi!
This is my first ever React JS Web App. `"Self-responsibility project"`.

Basically my application is pretty similar to the usual *todo-app*. But I did it more complicated, with more functionality than simple *todo-app* that you can imagine.

> Kinda `extended version` :)

## What technologies did I used?

*I did both design and development part. In future I also want to extend it with Node JS.*

- **Figma**
- **Adobe Photoshop CS6**
- **Inksape** (for icons)
- **React JS**
- **react-router-dom**
- **scss**

## How can you get it?
